# Costructing-Cointegrated-Cryptocurrency-Portfolios

It is my 15 ECTS Scientific Project of my MSc that I have completed last January, 2022. It is an individual project.  One of the major parts of it was data analysis and finding out cointegrated cryptocurriency portfolios from their historical time series daily data and hourly data of same time periods to find out if they have different results.

Out of 100 top cryptocurriencies based on their market capitals (November, 2021), I have made three different groups based on the transaction proof types they use (made these groups based on proof type communality). It is possible to make three different groups of 25 out of 100 top cryptocurriencies.
These groups are

	Proof Type- Proof of Work(PoW): Bitcoin, BitcoinSV,  Etherium, Etherium Classsic,  Litecoin,  Minota, Monero and Arweave.
This group of cryptos have longer period of data, so it is separated into two time periods two find out if they show different results in these two periods.

	Proof  Type- Delayed Proof of Stake(DPoS): Terra, Bittorrent, Tron,Cosmos and Tezos.

	Proof Type- Proof of Stake(PoS): Based on the launching date cryptos have different time periods of data. Based on the data availability, three subgroups were made. 

These subgroups are
1.	Pos_1:  Algorand, Cosmos, Crypto.com, Cardano and hedera hashgraph.
2.	Pos_2:  Near,  PayProtocol, Oasis labs, and terraUSD.
3.	Pos_3: Computer Internet, Avalanche, and Anchor Protocol.


	The analysis consists mainly
•	Descriptive Statistic
•	Stationarity Test Result
•	Engle-Grsnger Cointegration Test Results.

Data were collected from yahoo finance, cleaned/Prepared and further analysis was done by PYTHON.
